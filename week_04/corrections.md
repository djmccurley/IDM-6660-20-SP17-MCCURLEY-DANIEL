# Corrections - Week 4
## Changes based on feedback

### Fixed layout for narrower (320ish) layouts

The original page had issues at narrower widths, so fixed some things like the line spacing in the title and some margins/paddings and table text size to accomodate most phones.

### User interaction affordance
I made the interactive elements more visibly interactive to the users, including adding [+] symbols to the expandable articles and using Robert's suggestion for swiping gallery. 

### Visual balance issues
Adjusted the balance of dominant/subdominant/subordinate elements on the page. Made the H2s more dominant by highlighting in red gradient and by making the article H3s slightly smaller. Also added subtle box shadows to the elements to draw the eye and differentiate from the background.

## Changes I did not implement

### Table Alignment
I did not follow Emily's feedback of using the original center aligned table columns from the original site. The right aligned cells read much easier and faster.

### Brighter color palette/remove background image
Rather than removing the original background image and brighten up the color palette to match the images, I went the opposite direction. While the background image is not good by objective measures, it 100% fits with the brand and visual tone of Dutch Oven Bakery (I'm calling it retirement home chic now...) Same with the red/blue color palette. 

In order to balance the overbearing background of the original, I made the flat colors into subtle gradients from the orginal site, and I added small box shadows to the content elements. I also made the H2s more dominant and put in a solid bg color on all content. These changes help to offset the strong bg pattern and make it subordinate in this new version.

I also replaced the fun colorful images with more "traditional" images from the orignal site. These fit the color palette and BG well without completely rebranding the bakery in this mobile site.
